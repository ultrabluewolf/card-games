BS Card Game

Entire Deck shuffled and passed out to at least 3 players

Random player goes first; supposibly discards at least one Ace
Next player in clockwise order supposible discardts at least one 2
..
after King, the order restarts with Ace

Anytime after a player discards cards and before the next player goes, anyone can call out the player

if the player lied, they take the deck of discarded cards
otherwise, the other player who called out BS, takes the deck

--
goal:
discard entire hand

hands and deck are kept secret from all other players.

strategy:
For some player A and B from the set of players where size>=3:
A discards m cards. B with n amount of card type i, player A can determine whether to call out B:
 n=4, BS always; 
 n=3, m>1=>BS;
 n=2, m>2=>BS;
 n=1, m>3=>BS
